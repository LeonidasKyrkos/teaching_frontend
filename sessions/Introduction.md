# Frontend web development

Welcome to the YFS series on Frontend Development. The sessions herein will give you a grounding in modern frontend concepts, tools and styles, and hopefully provide you with enough understanding to start building your own interfaces.

To understand modern frontend development, it's important to know a bit about its foundations. In your day to day work at a digital agency you'll hear references to frameworks like Vue or Angular, but in this series we'll be staying as far away from them as humanly possible. If we get enough interest we can look at running a course on one of those in the future.

For this series; our definition for a website is a handwritten HTML document sitting in a folder on your computer. It wants to include a CSS file to make itself look fancy, and it wants to include a JavaScript file to make itself do cool stuff when the user interacts with it. We'll start by exploring HTML, then CSS, and finally JavaScript.
